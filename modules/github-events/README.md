# `github-events`

This module provisions infrastructure to listen to webhook events from GitHub and
publish them to a broker.

- https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads

Events are published as they are received from GitHub, and are not transformed in
any way. The events are published to a broker, which can be used to fan out the
events to other services, or filter based on their type.

You can use this with `cloudevent-recorder` to record GitHub events to a BigQuery table.

CloudEvent types are derived from the GitHub event type, and are prefixed with
`dev.chainguard.github`. For example, the `push` event is published as
`dev.chainguard.github.push`.

```hcl
// Create a network with several regional subnets
module "networking" {
  source = "chainguard-dev/common/infra//modules/networking"

  name       = "my-networking"
  project_id = var.project_id
  regions    = [...]
}

// Create the Broker abstraction.
module "cloudevent-broker" {
  source = "chainguard-dev/common/infra//modules/cloudevent-broker"

  name       = "my-broker"
  project_id = var.project_id
  regions    = module.networking.regional-networks
}

// Forward events to the broker.
module "github-events" {
  source = "./modules/github-events"

  project_id = var.project_id
  name       = "github-events"
  regions    = module.networking.regional-networks
  ingress    = module.cloudevent-broker.ingress

  // Which user is allowed to populate webhook secret values.
  secret_version_adder = "user:you@company.biz"
}
```

After applying this, generate a random secret value and add it to the GitHub
webhook config, and populate the secret version in the GCP Secret Manager.

## Using with `serverless-gclb`

To expose the service to the internet for production, you should use `serverless-gclb` to create a load-balanced public endpoint. This is the endpoint where GitHub will be configured to send webhook requests.

```hcl

data "google_dns_managed_zone" "top-level-zone" { name = "your-top-level-zone" }

module "serverless-gclb" {
  source = "chainguard-dev/common/infra//modules/serverless-gclb"

  name       = "github-events"
  project_id = var.project_id
  dns_zone   = data.google_dns_managed_zone.top-level-zone.name

  // Regions are all of the places that we have backends deployed.
  // Regions must be removed from serving before they are torn down.
  regions         = keys(module.networking.regional-networks)
  serving_regions = keys(module.networking.regional-networks)

  public-services = {
    // Matches github-events module name.
    "github.yourdomain.com" = { name = "github-events" }
  }
}
```

## Using with `INGRESS_TRAFFIC_ALL`

During development you may want to expose the service directly to the internet, without using a load balancer. This is useful for testing and development, but is **not recommended in production.**

```hcl
module "github-events" {
  source = "./modules/github-events"

  project_id = var.project_id
  name       = "github-events"
  regions    = module.networking.regional-networks
  ingress    = module.cloudevent-broker.ingress

  service-ingress = "INGRESS_TRAFFIC_ALL" // Expose the service to the internet.
}
```

The `public-urls` output will be populated with the `.run.app` URL for each regional service, which can be used to configure the GitHub webhook for testing.

## Using with `cloudevent-recorder`

The event payloads produced by this module are the full GitHub webhook payloads, and are not transformed in any way. If you want to record these events using `cloudevent-recorder`, you must set `ignore_unknown_fields`, since event payloads will not match the schema.

The schemas that describe which fields get recorded are defined in `./schemas/event_types.go`, and the BQ schemas are generated using `./cmd/schemagen`. To add fields or new types, modify the `event_types.go` file and run `go generate ./...`.

## Modifying Schema Names for Recorder

These schemas are used to generate bigquery table names used by the recorder. If you are adding a schema you're fine to proceed. If you are changing the name of a schema, or removing a schema, terraform will try to delete the old schema. The recorders have a parameter `deletion_protection` enabled by default so terraform will fail to delete the schema.

By default the recorder has `deletion_protection` enabled. When you change the name of a schema used by the recorder ([example](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/terraform-infra-common/pull/408)) terraform will attempt to delete the old bigquery table.

If the `deletion_protection` has not been disabled then you will find yourself in a state where terraform is trying to delete the resource but it cannot and you cannot set the `deletion_protection` bit for the table that needs to be deleted.

**NOTE:** _Please note that terraform "deleting the table" will.. delete the table. So make sure the proper backups are in place or you don't care about the data in the table. This guide is solely to avoid the footgun of deleting or renaming a schema without first disabling `deletion_protection`._

The proper way to handle this situation is

1. Disable `deletion_protection` for the recorder
2. Run terraform apply to disable the `deletion_protection` bit
3. Make the changes to the schema name and run terraform apply
4. Re-enable `deletion_protection` for the recorder
