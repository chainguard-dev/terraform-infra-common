A list of Knative Trigger-style filters over cloud event attributes.

Each filter is a map of attribute key-value pairs that must match exactly.
Multiple filters are combined with OR logic (any filter can match).

Examples:
  # Single event type
  filters = [

  ]

  # Multiple event types
  filters = [
